C - Recursion

### Recursion:
Recursion is a fundamental programming concept. In simple terms, it's a technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. This seemingly circular logic is incredibly powerful and allows functions to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler instances of the same problem.

### Key Points to Remember
When working with recursion, there are essential principles to keep in mind:

Base Case: Always define a base case that indicates when the recursion should stop. Without it, your recursive function may run indefinitely, causing problems like stack overflow errors 💻🌡️💥
