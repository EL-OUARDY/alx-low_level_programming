0x0D. C - Preprocessor

### Preprocessor:

Before the source code is converted into machine code or object code by the C compiler, it goes through a phase of textual transformations called the preprocessor. The preprocessor works on the source code before it is analyzed and compiled. It handles preprocessor directives, which are lines of code that begin with a # symbol.

### Why:

The primary purpose of the preprocessor is to prepare the source code for compilation by performing tasks such as:

1- Macro Expansion: The preprocessor replaces macro invocations with their corresponding definitions. Macros are defined using the #define directive.

2- File Inclusion: The preprocessor handles the #include directive, which allows the inclusion of header files or other C source files into the current source file.

3- Conditional Compilation: The preprocessor handles #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif directives to conditionally include or exclude blocks of code based on predefined macros or other conditions.

4- Removal of Comments: As mentioned earlier, the preprocessor removes all comments from the source code.

5- Stringization and Token Concatenation: The preprocessor performs stringization with the # operator and token concatenation with the ## operator.
