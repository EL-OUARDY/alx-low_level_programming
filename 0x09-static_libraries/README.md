C - Static libraries

### Static libraries:
Static libraries are collections of precompiled object files that can be linked with C programs.
They provide a way to organize and reuse commonly used code across multiple projects.
The code contained within a static library  is linked into the program at compile time, resulting in a standalone executable.
