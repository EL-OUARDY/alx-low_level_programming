# Alx Low Level Programming
Lets practice C Functions and nested loops
### Functions:
a group of statements that together perform a task. with functions we avoid duplicate code and have more readabilty of our program.
### Nested Loop:
a nested loop simply is a loop that run inside another loop. most use case is when we have a multidimentional array and we want to to go through every element.
