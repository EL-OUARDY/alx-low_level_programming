0x10. C - Variadic functions

### Variadic Functions:
Variadic functions in C are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. These functions provide a way to pass an arbitrary number of arguments of different types to the function. The standard C library includes several variadic functions, such as printf and scanf.

To declare a variadic function in C, you use an ellipsis (...) as the last parameter in the function's parameter list. Here's the general syntax:
```c
return_type function_name(type fixed_arg1, type fixed_arg2, ..., ...);
```
To access the variable arguments within a variadic function, you use the stdarg.h header, which provides a set of macros to handle the variable argument list. The main macros are:

`va_list` A type representing the variable argument list.\
`va_start` A macro that initializes the va_list to point to the first variable argument.\
`va_arg` A macro that retrieves the next argument of a specified type from the va_list.\
`va_end` A macro that cleans up the va_list after you finish using the variable arguments.

> Keep in mind that using variadic functions requires careful handling of the arguments and their types, as there is no type safety or compile-time checks for the variable arguments. Make sure to pass the correct number and types of arguments as expected by the function.
