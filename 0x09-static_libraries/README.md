C - Static libraries

## Static libraries:
Static libraries are collections of precompiled object files that can be linked with C programs.
They provide a way to organize and reuse commonly used code across multiple projects.
The code contained within a static library is linked into the program at compile time, resulting in a standalone executable.

### Static libraries Drawbacks:
Static libraries offer several benefits, but they also come with some drawbacks:

* Bigger Executables: When linking a static library(s) to a program, it includes all the library code that used in the executable. This can make the executable larger.

* No Updates Without Recompilation: If we want to update a part of the static library (for example, fixing a bug or adding a new feature), we need to recompile all the programs that use it. This can be impractical for large projects or when distributing software to end-users.

* Slower Build Times: If a project includes many large static libraries, it can significantly increase the build time since all the library code must be compiled into the program every time we build it.
