0x0D. C - Preprocessor

### Preprocessor:
The preprocessor in C is a phase of the compilation process that performs various textual transformations on the source code before the actual compilation takes place. It operates on the source code before it is parsed and compiled into machine code or object code. The preprocessor is a part of the C compiler and is responsible for handling preprocessor directives, which are lines of code that start with a # symbol.
### Why:
The primary purpose of the preprocessor is to prepare the source code for compilation by performing tasks such as:

1- Macro Expansion: The preprocessor replaces macro invocations with their corresponding definitions. Macros are defined using the #define directive.

2- File Inclusion: The preprocessor handles the #include directive, which allows the inclusion of header files or other C source files into the current source file.

3- Conditional Compilation: The preprocessor handles #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif, and #endif directives to conditionally include or exclude blocks of code based on predefined macros or other conditions.

4- Removal of Comments: As mentioned earlier, the preprocessor removes all comments from the source code.

5- Line Control: The #line directive allows you to change the line number and file name that the compiler associates with subsequent lines of code.

6- Stringization and Token Concatenation: The preprocessor performs stringization with the # operator and token concatenation with the ## operator.
