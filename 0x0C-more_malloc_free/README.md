C - More malloc, free

### Malloc Function:
The malloc() function is used to dynamically allocate memory at runtime.
It stands for "memory allocation"
malloc allows you to request a specific amount of memory from the operating system's heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.
You should always `free` all `malloc`'ed memory spaces.

### Calloc Function:
It stands for "cleared memory allocation." It is used to allocate a block of memory and initializes all the bytes to zero.

### Realloc Function:
It stands for "reallocate memory." It is used to change the size of a previously allocated memory block. It can be used to resize or shrink the memory block.


> Remember to manage dynamically allocated memory properly, as it is your responsibility to free the memory using free when you no longer need it to avoid memory leaks.
