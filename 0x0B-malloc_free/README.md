C - malloc, free

### Malloc Function:
The malloc() function is used to dynamically allocate memory at runtime.
It stands for "memory allocation"
malloc allows you to request a specific amount of memory from the operating system's heap and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.
You should always `free` all `malloc`'ed memory spaces.

### Free Function:
After allocating the memory, the program accesses and modifies the allocated memory block.
Finally, the free function is used to release the dynamically allocated memory, preventing memory leaks.
Speaking of memory leaks, `valgrind` is great tool to check for unwanted memory leaks
